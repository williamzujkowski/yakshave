# Deploy Demo Site to GitHub Pages
#
# IMPORTANT: This deploys a pre-built demo site from the repository.
#
# To update the demo:
#   1. Run `gh-year-end all --config config/config.yaml` locally
#   2. Commit the generated `site/2024/` directory
#   3. Push to main branch
#
# Future enhancement:
#   - Automate builds using a GitHub PAT (Personal Access Token)
#   - Generate site directly in CI instead of committing artifacts
#
# The demo is built from sample data in tests/fixtures/sample_org/
# and does not require real GitHub API access.
