# Deploy Year-End Report Site to GitHub Pages
#
# This workflow deploys the complete year-end report site, including:
#   - Root index.html with year redirection
#   - Year-specific directories (2024/, 2025/, etc.)
#   - Shared assets
#
# To update the site:
#   1. Run `gh-year-end all --config config/config.yaml` locally
#   2. Commit the generated `site/` directory
#   3. Push to main branch
#
# The workflow triggers on:
#   - Push to main when site/ changes
#   - Manual workflow dispatch
